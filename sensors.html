<body>
    <p>
        Sensors are an integral part of modern living. If you are reading this article on a computer,
         you are most likely using a mouse, which contains an optical sensor. 
         If you are on a smartphone, you are using touch sensors every time you touch the screen. But what exactly is a sensor?
A sensor is a device that measures physical input from its environment and converts it into data that can be interpreted by either a human or a machine.
 Most sensors are electronic (the data is converted into electronic data), but some are more simple, such as a glass thermometer, which presents visual data.
  People use sensors to measure temperature, gauge distance, detect smoke, regulate pressure and a myriad of other uses.
